   ```

### Manual Installation (MintyInstall still required)

If RunWindows.bat or RunUnix.sh fails:

```batch
# Navigate to the EngineWS directory
cd BetterMint/EngineWS

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### Chrome Extension Setup

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
